It seemed to me that this was unlikely ever to matter, since the real dispute between the parties lies in the ultimate commercial use of the Haliade-X which it is accepted will not be entitled to that defence.

It is true that that has been a large part of his personal experience but (a) the Patent is very largely about bearings and the forces that act on them, (b) he knew about wind turbines himself from extensive practical experience, and (c) he envisaged the skilled person knowing about them to an appropriate degree and while perhaps he saw that knowledge coming from reading rather than experience to a surprising degree, it did not matter.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">ii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That he was not transparent about the research he did to found his views on the CGK and had an inappropriately liberal or expansive view of what was CGK.  As to the first, I did not think it mattered in practical terms that he e.g. did a Google Scholar search to avoid “weird stuff”.  As to the second, I think it is true that he set the bar for CGK rather low, and I take that into account when I assess, in particular, Stander and the designs it references.  But it had no impact on his evidence as to what would be obvious to do once one has identified the CGK.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That his explanation of the prior art was hard to follow and that he was applying the standard of what he would do, rather than what the notional, uninventive skilled person would do.

They would need knowledge of mechanical, structural and electrical engineering and practical experience of wind turbines and their main components, including in particular their bearings.  Given this range of disciplines it is probable that a team rather than one individual would be needed in real life, but nothing turns on this and I will just refer to “the skilled person”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_18"><span class="judgment-body__number">18.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There are two matters concerning the attitudes of the skilled person that were disputed and that I consider relevant.

There seemed to be agreement, and I find, that this was a field in which safety was very important and that wind turbine designs would be understood to have to meet very demanding standards of durability and reliability.  To give a flavour of this, Dr Santos referred frequently to the need for a design to be such that it could be predicted to be in operation for 95% of the time over 20 years.  I accept that that was generally seen as desirable and that this was a demanding field in which to work as a result.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_20"><span class="judgment-body__number">20.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, Dr Santos went further and said that the skilled person would not be interested in progressing any design until he or she could be sure that it had already accrued a very long period of successful use in practice and in multiple locations.  GE submitted that he had said that a design would need a 20-year track record.  I do not think he did, and there may have been some misunderstanding, but certainly he said that a very substantial period of successful use was seen as necessary and Siemens made that part of its case.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_21"><span class="judgment-body__number">21.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This point is primarily relevant to which of the proposed designs in Stander the skilled person would be interested in progressing and it was in that context that much of the cross-examination took place.

I prefer the more flexible attitude put forward by Prof Slocum; more established designs would have that in their favour but newer, or even untested ones, would be assessed on the merits while taking into account their relative lack of use.  Quite apart from anything else, if Dr Santos were right then new designs in the industry would have come along at a snail’s pace, which does not seem to have been the case.  Further, the industry needed to react to changing external requirements as they arose. Ever-bigger turbines were needed, yet there was no sign that the players in the field hesitated to set about designing them.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_23"><span class="judgment-body__number">23.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second matter concerns the approach to designing wind turbines.  In the Annex to his first report, Prof Slocum presented an analysis of forces, moments, deflections and so on for a rotating shaft support bearing, and it was at this general level of complexity that he looked at the prior art.  He referred to it in his oral evidence as the “teeter-totter”, which is the American English word for seesaw.  I will use it as a convenient shorthand, although the mechanical arrangement in a wind turbine has more elements than a simple seesaw.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_24"><span class="judgment-body__number">24.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Santos said that no wind turbine would ever be designed on such a simplistic basis and that much more complex computer analyses were needed in real life.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_25"><span class="judgment-body__number">25.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I do not think the experts’ views were in fact inconsistent.  Prof Slocum was talking about a first-cut but scientifically sound analysis that would be undertaken at the beginning of a design process or to assess an existing or proposed design at a high level.  Dr Santos was talking about the later, detailed design for actually advancing a real turbine towards production and use.  I find that Prof Slocum’s level of analysis would be applied to understand the pros and cons of designs at the sort of level of detail given in the prior art and, indeed, the Patent.  His level of analysis would, for example, support an understanding of the correctness of the “key idea” at [0010] of the Patent.</p></div></section><section><p><b>THE COMMON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE</b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_26"><span class="judgment-body__number">26.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A joint, agreed document showed the agreed CGK (the “ASCGK”).

This happens in particular where the patentee seeks to rely on how the invention works and what it is trying to accomplish.  These objections are generally misconceived, in my view.  “Normal” interpretation includes purposive matters of this kind.  Equivalence arises on top of normal interpretation and that is what has to be pleaded.  Thus in the present case GE argued, at least at one stage, that Siemens’ arguments about how press-fitting works were not allowed because they were unpleaded.

In particular, and intending no disrespect to the judges in the relevant decisions or to the researches of Counsel in this case, I think Arnold J’s points about territoriality are important and would need more research.

I fail to see any motivation for making the change, and in the absence of an off-the-shelf CGK bearing being known to the skilled person I do not think it would have occurred to them at all.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_179"><span class="judgment-body__number">179.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So I reject the case of obviousness over Loeschner against claim 1 of the Patent.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_180"><span class="judgment-body__number">180.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Had I been wrong about that, it would have been necessary to consider claims 3 and 6, which were said to have independent validity.

I have held in relation to CGK that that is a conventional way of showing a rolling element bearing and that is how it is used in the drawing.  But there is more to it than that, because the entry for design B4 in Table I says that the bearing type is “Mechanical/magnetic”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_196"><span class="judgment-body__number">196.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I find that as a matter of disclosure “Mechanical/magnetic” indicates two discrete options, of which one is then taken forward into the drawing for B4; I do not think that “Mechanical/magnetic” introduces a lack of clarity but it does present a choice.  In fact, the idea of using a magnetic bearing would be an extremely speculative one and would not be taken forward by the skilled person, but that is the province of obviousness.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_197"><span class="judgment-body__number">197.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to the second point, neither Table I nor the drawing of configuration B4 in Figure 3 shows how the annular member protruding into the hub is attached to the outer ring of the bearing, although it is clear that it must be.  So GE has to rely on the general statement on the next page of Stander that bearing fixtures are either bolt-on or press fitted.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_198"><span class="judgment-body__number">198.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The problem with this is that it is a very general statement which is not referable to the specific configurations in Figure 3.  GE argued that the disclosure is of two choices for the bearing (magnetic or rolling element) and two choices for the attachment (bolt-on or press fit), and that each of the four (two times two) possibilities is thereby disclosed.  I reject this.  Sometimes disclosures, especially patents, do present things like this, by providing multiple lists together, from each of which a choice is to be made.  Stander is not like that, though: the disclosure of press fitting is general and not tied to Figure 3 (as I already said), and there is no direction about combining the various options.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_199"><span class="judgment-body__number">199.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So I reject the anticipation argument.  Had the only aspect been the mechanical/magnetic bearing choice I would have held that there are two options each of which is disclosed, particularly given the drawing of configuration B4.

Although it said that there is no anticipation by Stander, for reasons which I have just considered and accepted, Siemens accepts that <i>if</i> the skilled person progressed configuration B4 they would certainly not choose a magnetic bearing but would use a mechanical, rolling element one, and that press fitting would be an obvious option.  So the question on obviousness over Stander boils down to whether or not it would be obvious to progress configuration B4 into actual development, and I turn to consider that.</p></div></section><section><p><u>Pozzoli analysis</u></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_202"><span class="judgment-body__number">202.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have identified the skilled team and the CGK above.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_203"><span class="judgment-body__number">203.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the circumstances of this case it is not necessary to try to formulate a statement of the inventive concept of the Patent or to list the claim features that represent the difference between Stander and the Patent because for reasons I have explained at the end of the anticipation section of this judgment above, the question is simply whether it would have been obvious to take configuration B4 forwards.</p></div></section><section><p><u>Pozzoli 4, assessment</u></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_204"><span class="judgment-body__number">204.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In assessing Stander, I will bear in mind the characteristics of the notional skilled person.

There is a danger of answering that question with an undue and artificial focus brought about by Figure 3 being at the heart of the current dispute; the skilled person would not know that.  Also, although the skilled person is diligent and careful, it is not legitimate to argue that they would by definition look at every reference.

He or she would analyse them in a careful way, but without invention.  Siemens’ argument that the skilled person would confine themselves to the CGK configurations has something of the <i>Brugger</i> fallacy about it.

They would think that was so because they would recognise a number of the names in the “Examples” column and from the general tenor of Stander.  They would not have certainty about this, though, as evidenced by the fact that Prof Slocum himself changed his mind about MTorres as more information became available.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_210"><span class="judgment-body__number">210.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I think that degree of confidence would be more than enough for the skilled person to progress to the stage of doing a systematic analysis of the configurations in Figure 3 at the “teeter-totter” sort of level, and I consider below where that would go.  This would not be “blue-sky” research, it would just be simple analysis to understand what was being taught.  The skilled person would be a good deal less likely to include the triple bearing arrangements, mainly because there was no CGK design of that kind.  They would have a focus, although not an exclusive one, on the double bearing arrangements because of the teaching in section 2.2 that single bearings would limit scalability, in the context of the move in the industry to ever larger turbines.  I should say that Dr Santos did not agree with that teaching, and said that single bearing arrangements were seen to have their benefits for larger turbines.  I accept that it was not a one-way street or entirely simple, but find that the issues raised by Stander with single bearing arrangements were sensible and real.  Its teaching of double bearing arrangements being more scalable would be accepted by the skilled person as at the very least a  strong motivating factor sufficient to be willing to take them forward.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_211"><span class="judgment-body__number">211.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Since I think the skilled person would be willing to assess the double-bearing drawings in Figure 3 on their engineering merits, it is not very important whether they would have followed up by reading Klinger, or the other references.

I find that the skilled person would think this (i.e. the entry in Table I) was a slip.  They would not know exactly how the slip had happened. They would see that the design on the upper left of page 17 was attributed to Gen<u>e</u>sys and that it was configuration B1.  It is quite possible, though not necessary to my analysis, that they would think the names Vensys and Gensys were accidentally swapped around in Table I.

That would support the conclusion, which they would anyway have regarded as likely from Stander itself, that configuration B4 was in use at a modest, possibly prototype level.  Allowing for the configuration being misnamed in Table I, this would also fit with their CGK about Vensys as a company.  They would appreciate that Vensys’ market penetration was very modest compared with Enercon and Goldwind.  This would of course be a relevant consideration for them, but it would not dent their appreciation that configuration B4 was a real design and not a paper proposal.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_216"><span class="judgment-body__number">216.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel for Siemens argued that since the peer reviewers of Stander did not cross-check Table I against Klinger, nor would the skilled person.

They ought to have done, but then they ought not to have allowed the errors in Table I through in any event.

I accept the overall thrust of his evidence on this.  The skilled person’s reaction would be that Table I was, surprisingly for an academic article, very sloppily put together.

However, this does not materially undermine his evidence.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_224"><span class="judgment-body__number">224.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Prof Slocum’s analysis of the configurations from Figure 3 is approximately at the level of the teeter-totter, although it is qualitative and not quantitative.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_225"><span class="judgment-body__number">225.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Prof Slocum said that the skilled person would do the quantitative teeter-totter analysis of the Annex of his first report “to position and size the bearings” of configurations B1 and B4.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_226"><span class="judgment-body__number">226.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In relation to the specific details of this analysis, Siemens made a number of points.  Three main ones were that:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">i)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Design B4 might not in fact intend the upwind bearing to be inside the hub, because all that Table I said was that it was upwind of the stator.  I reject this; the drawings in Figure 3 are quite careful and where it was intended to show bearings at the edge of the hub, that was done.  The member going into the hub to mount the bearing inside it (what is called the annular member in the Patent) is clearly deliberate.  If the skilled person did look at Klinger, this is even clearer.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">ii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Prof Slocum did not in fact do the teeter-totter analysis for Stander configuration B4 but only for Hua, and he referenced the latter when defending his evidence on Stander in cross-examination.  Siemens argued that as a result he was unable to show that following up configuration B4 would result in a bearing inside the hub.  I reject this, too.  The point on Hua and Stander was very similar and was simply: would numerical analysis show that moving the bearing nearer the centre of mass would help?  The example analysis with Hua showed that it would (which is hardly surprising since it is simple mechanics, and true, being the basis of the Patent).  It was perfectly plausible for Prof Slocum to say that he could read across from Hua to Stander in this way.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Prof Slocum had muddled up the centre of stiffness and the centre of mass.  I do not accept this.  He refers to them in footnote 31 of his second report and his analysis of configuration B4 seemed consistent with what he said there.  He certainly did not accept any such criticism.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_227"><span class="judgment-body__number">227.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Santos’ evidence was chiefly to the following effect (I say nothing about the errors in Table I at this stage since Prof Slocum accepted their existence and I have already covered it above, but I do note that Dr Santos did not in his written evidence say that the errors were such that the skilled person would discard Stander):</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">i)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The skilled person would not give Stander much weight because its authors were not well known.  I agree this is a factor but only a minor one. The skilled person would read the document with interest (as the law requires) and primarily assess it on its technical merit.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">ii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Stander has a leaning towards single bearing configurations.  I do not think that is really complete.  It recognises that they are conventional but says they could have problems of scalability in moving to bigger turbines.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The skilled person would only be interested in progressing the CGK configurations A1, A2, and B2.  I did not find that convincing for  reasons given above.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iv)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That the skilled person would not analyse all the configurations in Table 3 because it would be too much work.  I accept that they would not analyse them all, and have already found that they would not be interested in the triple bearing arrangements.  But I do not consider that the point has force in relation to configuration B4, again for reasons given above, and I do not accept that the level of analysis would be especially great, or any material deterrent.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">v)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In relation to B4 specifically, that it might imperil the air gap.  Prof Slocum recognised this as a factor in the evidence I have referred to above but said that it was a trade-off.  I agree that the skilled person would think it was something to watch out for and is one reason for doing a more quantitative analysis.  On the other hand the skilled person would see there definitely was an advantage in B4 in terms of reducing the load on the bearing.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_228"><span class="judgment-body__number">228.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although I am sure he was sincere in giving it, I did not find Dr Santos’ evidence at all convincing.  In particular, I thought his view that the skilled person would be blinkered and unwilling to consider anything new was unrealistic in the circumstances of this art, and generally.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_229"><span class="judgment-body__number">229.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I therefore uphold the attack of obviousness over Stander on the basis that progressing configuration B4 was one of a relatively small number of obvious routes forward from it.  It was not suggested that any dependent claim could help Siemens and, as I have said, although the use of a mechanical bearing and of a press fit for configuration B4 were not disclosed to the anticipation standard they were clearly very obvious options once the decision was taken to progress configuration B4.</p></div></section><section><p><b>INSUFFICIENCY</b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_230"><span class="judgment-body__number">230.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">GE argued that the Patent is insufficient because its claims cover (or, on its case, are limited to) turbines in which the annular member is truly integral with the outer ring of the bearing; and further, the claims cover very large turbines.  GE says that that means that the claims cover things that are not enabled.</p></div></section><section><p><b>The allegations and the facts</b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_231"><span class="judgment-body__number">231.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have sketched out the nature of GE’s argument.  There is rather more detail to it, as I will now explain:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">i)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is common ground that the claims of the Patent would <i>cover</i> the situation where the annular member is truly integral with the outer ring of the bearing.  GE says that that is always necessary to fall within the claims while Siemens says it is an option.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">ii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The claims of the Patent do not require any particular size of turbine, but the specification stresses the particular usefulness of the invention for larger sizes.  I have touched on the relevant passages when narrating the specification.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">GE argued, supported by Prof Slocum, that it would not be possible to make a large rolling element bearing outer ring that was truly integral with the annular member.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iv)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The details of why that is so do not matter, but in very brief outline it has to do with accomplishing a very large casting and at the same time being able to achieve the very demanding material qualities and tolerances of the outer ring.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">v)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The reason the details do not matter is that Dr Santos did not challenge Prof Slocum’s evidence about the practical difficulties.  His response, and Siemens’ answer, was that the skilled person would not be worried about the difficulties because they would know they could use press fitting or the like.  So they would not think they needed to make a very large, truly integral assembly.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">vi)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">GE does not challenge the factual proposition that a press-fit solution would work, but says that there is still insufficiency in law because the claim covers (or is limited to) the truly integral option.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">vii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The specification also discusses casting the annular member in one piece with the rotor hub itself.  This, Prof Slocum said, would be even more difficult.  Again, he was not challenged, but again Siemens’ answer was that a press fit solution would be used.  So I did not think this changed the overall argument.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">viii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In closing submissions, GE argued that the attack applied both to rolling element bearings and to sliding/journal bearings.  As I read the pleadings and evidence, GE’s case was not really about the latter.  It does not matter to my analysis, though.</p></div></section></div></section><section><p><b>Legal standard</b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_232"><span class="judgment-body__number">232.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">GE argued that the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Regeneron v Kymab</i> [2020] UKSC 27, particularly at [56], was applicable to this kind of attack.  I was also referred to the discussion of that decision in the judgment of Birss LJ (sitting at first instance) in <i>Illumina v Latvia MGI</i> [2021] EWHC 57 (Pat), at [257]-[259] and [276]-[279].</p></div></section><section><p><b>Analysis</b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_233"><span class="judgment-body__number">233.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Since the facts are not in dispute and since I find that the Patent is invalid over Stander for obviousness, I will be brief in my analysis.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_234"><span class="judgment-body__number">234.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I agree with GE that although not expressly mentioned in the claim, size is a relevant range in the <i>Regeneron</i> sense.  It is of the essence of the invention that moving the bearing inside the rotor hub allows bigger turbines to be made.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_235"><span class="judgment-body__number">235.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">But I do not accept that the bearing type and/or the requirement to be truly integral is a relevant range.  It would be a matter of indifference to the skilled reader of the Patent, so far as achieving the benefits promised, that they needed to use a press fit for larger turbines (whether with rolling element bearings, or, so far as it mattered, journal bearings).  Of course there would be technical work to do whatever they chose, but it would not have an impact on the benefit of the invention.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_236"><span class="judgment-body__number">236.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So I think in the present case the allegation is close to the chocolate tea pot referred to by Birss LJ in <i>Illumina</i> and quite different from the size of insert considered in <i>Regeneron</i>.  As Birss LJ said at (in particular) [278] and [279](iv) in <i>Illumina</i>, any descriptive language will cover a range of things and that in itself does not mean that it constitutes a relevant range in the <i>Regeneron</i> sense.  Usually, descriptive or functional language will not cause a problem.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_237"><span class="judgment-body__number">237.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I also found it helpful to this analysis to think more generally about what the skilled person’s reaction to the specification would be in the respects relevant to this argument.  It would be “Yes, I see that putting the bearing inside the hub will help with bigger turbines.  I know I won’t be able to make a monolithic annular member/bearing outer ring at that scale but I don’t care because I can just use press fitting”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_238"><span class="judgment-body__number">238.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Seen in this way, I think that the insufficiency allegation is not consistent with, and indeed damages, GE’s position on claim interpretation.  It would not make sense for the skilled person to think that “integral” was limited to truly integral and excluded press-fitting when that was exactly what the skilled person would think was necessary to make the invention work at the large scale to which it was specifically directed.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_239"><span class="judgment-body__number">239.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I therefore reject the insufficiency attack.</p></div></section><section><p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_240"><span class="judgment-body__number">240.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">My conclusions are:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">i)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Patent is invalid for obviousness over Stander.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">ii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The obviousness and anticipation attacks over Loeschner, the anticipation attack over Stander, and the insufficiency allegation all fail.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iii)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to infringement:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">a)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Neither the fully assembled Haliade-X nor its hub fall within the scope of claims 1 or 9 (respectively) of the Patent.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">b)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is therefore no infringement.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">c)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dogger Bank is not within the territorial ambit of the Patents Act 1977 so GE’s acts there would not be infringements anyway.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">d)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">But had I been wrong about the meaning of claim 9, it would have been infringed by GE’s acts in relation to the Haliade-X rotor hub in mainland UK, in particular at Able Seaton.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">iv)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I do not need to decide “kit of parts” and decline to do so.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_241"><span class="judgment-body__number">241.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I will hear Counsel as to the form of Order if it cannot be agreed.
