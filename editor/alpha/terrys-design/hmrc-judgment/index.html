The court distinguished such documents from the solicitor’s advice on the wisdom or otherwise of proceeding with a conveyancing transaction which is privileged, and in <i>DAC Beachcroft LLP v HMRC</i> [2018] UKFTT 502 (TC) this Tribunal held that various documents created in the course of conveyancing transactions (such as a signed form of authority and a deed of declaration of trust) were outside the scope of legal advice privilege. Whilst these decisions are made in relation to advice privilege under English law (and the decision of the Divisional Court is a decision of an English court in relation to English criminal law), Northern Irish law relating to privilege has similarities to English law, and these decisions give an indication of the limitations of advice privilege in relation to conveyancing transactions.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_53"><span class="judgment-body__number">53.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have considered the potential application of the Information Notice Regulations which deal with disputes as to the extent of legal professional privilege.
